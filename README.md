# Poverty in Mexico: trends and challenges after Covid-19
## A complex data visualization project

The main objective of this project is to visualize statistics of poverty and social deprivation in Mexico at the subnational level, from 2008 to 2018. The main factors analyzed are total population classified as poor, income levels, and access to health services. Epidemiology statistics of COVID-19 from January 1st, 2020 to July 1st, 2020, have been included in order to gain additional insights about the social effects of the pandemic. Epidemiology statistics are disaggregated by municipalities.

The main tools used for creating the visualizations were: **Google Charts API**, **D3 Java Script library** and **Tableau Public**.

The raw data was extracted from the National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy and the Ministry of Health of Mexico. The data preprocessing, cleaning, and consolidation was done in Python 3.7.6. In order to create the map of municipalities, the shape files containing information about the coordinates of each municipality were pulled from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico.
